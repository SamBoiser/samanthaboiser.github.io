title: Cleaned Twitter Data - TeachThought
---

Okay, I retried the exercise - This time I focused on tweets from @TeachThought, a popular education-focused twitter account. I looked for tweets within May 8 and June 8, to observe patterns before and after the death of George Floyd.

Here's the graph of Reweets, Favorites, and Frequency by date:

It's a little hard to see the Frequency because of the scale of the y-axis, right? So here's that in detail now:

Here's a [link](https://github.com/SamBoiser/samboiser.github.io/blob/master/TeachThought.xls) to my raw and cleaned data.

You can scroll down to find cleaned data and a graph of the above variables. The graph titled Frequency details the frequency of tweets, since it is a little hard to see in the first graph.
