title: Cleaned Twitter Data
---

Okay, I retried the exercise - This time I focused on tweets from @TeachThought, a popular education-focused twitter account. I looked for tweets within May 8 and June 8, to observe patterns before and after the death of George Floyd.

Here's a [link](TeachThought.xls) of the Retweets, Likes, and Frequency of tweets by date.

You can scroll down to find cleaned data and a graph of the above variables. The graph titled Frequency details the frequency of tweets, since it is a little hard to see in the first graph.
