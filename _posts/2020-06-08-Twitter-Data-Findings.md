title: Education Reform Twitter Data Results
---

## <Education Reform Query Search>

I used the words **Education Reform** to pull the past 1100 tweets before June 7, 2020. Admittedly, I had a lot of trouble visualizing the data. But I have learned a few things:
* Pulling Data from Twitter
  * Thanks to all the tutorials, I now realize how easy it is to pull specific data! It's incredible.
  * I'd still like to know how to pull multiple key words, and if words have to be separated in a certain way. All very cool.
* Markdown
  * I now better understand how to format things in Markdown, hopefully demonstrated by this post. I now see why a file ends with .md
  * I understand how to include images, but I still need to understand how to include graphs saved on my computer and the like.
* Excel vs. R
  * Working through the textbook, I thought I understood R enough to be able to do the same with my own data. However, uploading data is still a wonder to me...
  * I've worked through many tutorials and can't seem to understand how to create graphs using my own data, and not just existing packages.
  * I wonder if it has something to do with major editing through excel before uploading.
* Data analysis/Text analysis
  * Maybe this shoud have been listed first, but I realize I have no idea what I want to do with my data.
  * Analyzing favorites/retweets and replies and linear correlations is easy enough, but then what? How can I cross-reference keywords such as education reform and black lives matter.

Ultimately, I've become both increasingly _frustrated_ but all the more _intrigued_ and _interested_ with the data programming world.
They say
> The more you know, the more you realize you don't know.

Or something like that. And now I fear that I won't be able to successfully implement my project. Nevertheless, I'm really appreciating all the learning.

Signing off,
