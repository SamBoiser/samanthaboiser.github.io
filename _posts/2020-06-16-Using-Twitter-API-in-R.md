I used data from 100 @BrookingsInst tweets and created a graph to show the relationships between twitter users.

While the size of the label implies number of mentions, the other prominent nodes did not show up until I changed the number of mentions to _more than 5_ (instead of Professor's program of more than 20). With a smaller data set of a 100 tweets, this makes sense.
Of course, labeling these other nodes would help identify potential major relationships with the Brookings Institute. As the Institue is a prominent think tank, potential influences in both directions could shed light on biases and more.

Thus, it's worth looking into, and even creating more graphs, for the accounts
